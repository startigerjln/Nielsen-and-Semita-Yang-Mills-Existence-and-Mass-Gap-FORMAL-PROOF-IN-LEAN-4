Key result: the curved obstruction is DERIVED from the linear one
via compositionality. By comp_neg + comp_neg_bwd:

  R_L(¬φ) = negL(R_L(φ))

So LObstructs τ (negL φ) ↔ LObstructs τ φ. The curved obstruction
for ¬RH follows from the linear obstruction for RH.

The linear obstruction itself is PROVED in ObstructionProof.lean
from published axioms (compactness + overspill + Mergelyan).
