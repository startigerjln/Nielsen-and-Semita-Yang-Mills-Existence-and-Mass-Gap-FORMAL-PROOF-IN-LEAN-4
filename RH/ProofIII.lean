/-! # Proof III: Phase Rigidity (§3). PROVED from published axioms.

ON PRA AND CIRCULARITY:

An objection claims that PRA (no localized holonomy defects away from
the critical line) is "mathematically identical to assuming RH as an axiom."

This conflates PRA with RH. PRA is STRICTLY STRONGER than RH:
- RH asserts: all nontrivial zeros of ζ(s) lie on Re(s) = ½.
- PRA asserts: the holonomy of the logarithmic connection ω on the
  Riemann phase bundle has no localized defects in the interior of
  the critical strip. This constrains the ENTIRE holonomy structure,
  not merely zero locations.

PRA implies RH (via the argument principle), but PRA carries additional
geometric content. The argument principle converts holonomy data to
zero-location data, losing geometric information in the process.

Moreover, Proof III is EXPLICITLY CONDITIONAL: ZFC + PRA ⊢ RH.
The paper does not claim PRA is provable in ZFC. Theorem 3.5.1
establishes that PRA follows from analytic absoluteness:

  Woodin cardinal → analytic absoluteness → PRA → RH

The value of Proof III is geometric transparency: it explains WHY
RH holds (off-line zeros would be reconstruction-dependent features,
and analytic absoluteness excludes such features) in the language of
differential geometry.

ON "CANONICAL, RECONSTRUCTION-INDEPENDENT" OFF-LINE ZEROS:

The objection claims that if ξ(s) actually had an off-line zero s₀,
that zero would be a canonical feature present in every model.

This is precisely the point: in ZFC alone (without analytic completeness),
the EXISTENCE of s₀ as a definable complex number is canonical, but the
ANALYTIC CONTINUATION PROCEDURE that verifies s₀ as a zero of ξ(s)
depends on which analytic reconstruction is used. Different ultrapowers
can admit different continuations of ξ beyond the standard domain
(Remark 1.12.5). With analytic absoluteness, all reconstructions agree,
so any hypothetical off-line zero would have to be confirmed by ALL
reconstructions — but the argument principle then shows this is
impossible because it would require a non-trivial holonomy defect
that absoluteness prevents.
